  <h4>William James - The Will to Believe and Human Immortality</h4>
What&#8217;s a mistake but a kind of take?<br>
What&#8217;s nausea but a kind of -ausea?<br>
Sober, drunk, <em>-unk</em>, astonishment.<br>
    Everything can become the subject of criticism &#8211; how criticise without something <em>to</em> criticise?<br>
Agreement &#8211; disagreement!!<br>
Emotion &#8211; motion!!!<br>
Die away from, <em>from</em>, die away (without the <em>from</em>).<br>
Reconciliation of opposites; sober, drunk, all the same!<br>
Good and evil reconciled in a laugh!<br>
It escapes, it escapes!<br>
But &#8212;&#8211;<br>
What escapes, WHAT escapes?</p>

<p>Emphasis, EMphasis; there must be some emphasis in order for there to be a phasis.<br>
No verbiage can give it, because the verbiage is <em>other</em>.<br>
<em>In</em>coherent, coherent &#8211; same.<br>
And it fades! And it&#8217;s infinite! AND it&#8217;s infinite!<br>
If it wasn&#8217;t <em>going</em>, why should you hold on to it?<br>
Don&#8217;t you see the difference, don&#8217;t you see the identity?<br>
Constantly opposites united!<br>
The same me telling you to write and not to write!<br>
Extreme &#8211; extreme, extreme! Within the extensity that &#8217;extreme contains is contained the &#8216;<em>extreme</em>&#8217; of <em>in</em>tensity.<br>
Something, and <em>other</em> than that thing!<br>
Intoxication, and <em>otherness</em> than intoxication.<br>
Every attempt at betterment, &#8211;every attempt at otherment,<br>
&#8211;is a &#8212;-.<br>
It fades forever and forever as we move.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> a reconciliation!<br>
Reconciliation &#8211; <em>e</em>conciliation!<br>
By God, how that hurts! By God, how it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> hurt!<br>
Reconciliation of two extremes.<br>
By George, nothing but <em>oth</em>ing!<br>
That sounds like nonsense, but it is pure onsense!<br>
Thought deeper than speech &#8212;-!<br>
Medical school; divinity school, <em>school!</em>, SCHOOL! Oh my God, oh God, oh God!.</p>

<p>The most coherent and articulate sentence which came was this: &#8211;<br>
<b>There are no differences but differences of degree between different degrees of difference and no difference.
